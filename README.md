**Subject:**

Thesis, submitted to the University of New Hampshire in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Information Technology

**Purpose:**

To build an object recognition system that finds ASL letters gestures and translates them to English letters.


**Description:**

To implement this, I will use MATLAB_R2019a and Computer Vision System Toolbox that offers a variety of built-in tools to help create image classification and object recognition systems. This includes the ability to process and build models using training datasets, validate these models using test datasets, perform advanced feature extraction, and predict and categorize input images correctly.
