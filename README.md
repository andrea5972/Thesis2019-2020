**Author:** Andrea Murphy

**Date:** Spring 2020

**Subject:**

Thesis, submitted to the University of New Hampshire in Partial Fulfillment of the Requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Information Technology

**Purpose:**

To explore MATLAB's Data Science tools 


**Description:**

To implement this, I will use MATLAB_R2019a. Along with their Computer Vision System, Deep Learning, and Machine Learning Toolbox's. To create algorithms for image classification and object recognition systems. This includes the ability to process and build models using training datasets, validate these models using test datasets, perform advanced feature extraction, and predict and categorize input images correctly.
